                <p class = "bio text">I am an avid learner and determined problem-solver.  I thrive on the excitement of thoroughly understanding complex issues, digging into the details, and emerging with solutions that address more than the initial puzzle.  I recently graduated from Thinkful’s Full Stack Engineering bootcamp, and I enjoy connecting the dots between the front and back-end.</p>
                <br>
                <p class = "bio-text">When I’m not coding, I am exploring other ways to broaden my experiences.  Sometimes that means exposing my palette to new flavors, testing out my culinary chops with a challenging new recipe, or curling up with a big book (and my two cats!).  Other times you may find me on a solo hike with my camera in hand, attempting top roping outdoors, or perhaps learning the fine art of whitewater kayaking.</p>

Each question is presented as a multiple choice, requires the user to answer before progressing, and does not allow the user to retry questions.  Users receive a success message or corrected answer, depending upon their selection, and their updated score after each submission.  The final step presents the total score and the ability to restart the quiz.</p>
